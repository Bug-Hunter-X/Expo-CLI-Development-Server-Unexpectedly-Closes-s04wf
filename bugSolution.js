The intermittent nature of the bug makes definitive solutions tricky. To address potential issues, consider the following:

1. **Check for Memory Leaks:** Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify any potential memory leaks in your React components. Large components or uncontrolled state can lead to memory exhaustion.
2. **Reduce Unused Dependencies:** Review your `package.json` and remove unused dependencies. Extra packages add overhead and can contribute to instability.
3. **Increase Development Server Resources:** If using a virtual machine or a resource-constrained system, increasing the allocated memory or CPU might help.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache and node modules and then rebuilding: `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start`.
5. **Restart your machine:** A simple restart can sometimes resolve resource-related issues. 
6. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI: `expo upgrade`.
7. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Check if your Expo SDK version is compatible with your current setup, and consider upgrading if necessary.

// bug.js (Example showing potential large component)
import React from 'react';

const LargeComponent = () => {
  // Demonstrates a large array that might contribute to memory issues
  const largeArray = Array(100000).fill(0);
  return (
      <div>{largeArray.map((item, index) => <div key={index}>{item}</div>)}</div>
  );
};

// bugSolution.js (Example with improved memory management - reducing the large array)
import React from 'react';

const SmallerComponent = () => {
  const smallerArray = Array(10000).fill(0); // significantly smaller array
  return (
     <div>{smallerArray.map((item, index) => <div key={index}>{item}</div>)}</div>
  );
};
