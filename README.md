The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. The solution provided addresses potential causes and offers strategies for debugging.

## Bug Description

The Expo development server would randomly close after a period of inactivity or after making certain code changes.

2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the behavior; server might close after several minutes of inactivity or after code modifications.
